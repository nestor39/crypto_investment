# Cryptocurrency investments

This code was created with the purpose of assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. In this code I added new unsupervised learning skills. I created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. Then,I plotted the results so that I can visually show the performance.


## Technologies
```
pandas
hvplot.pandas
